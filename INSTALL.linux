CHECK http://www.trinitycore.info/w/Linux_Build_HOWTO FOR FURTHER HELP

Installing Trinity Core is fairly simple on a Linux machine, assuming
you have all required applications

The most important ones are:

    g++
    gcc
    make
    cmake version 2.6.x or greater
    libmysql++-dev
    subversion (for checking out Trinity Database)
    mercurial (for checking out the core)
    openssl
    libssl-dev
    zlib1g-dev
    libtool
    libmysqlclient15-dev
    patch
    build-essential
    mysql-client
    
Most of these are included on common Linux distros, others you may have to install by your self. 
Please check your distro's repos.

Make a directory to build in, you can call it anything you want like build or bin etc, then go into 
the directory and cmake and make. E.G. you created a dir named build ad want to have your final
 compiled product installed in /home/trinity/server, an example sequence of commands can be : 

    cmake ../ -DPREFIX=/home/trinity/server
    make
    make install
    
Thats just about all thats needed. You can however tweak more settings than where to install using flags built into our cmake files. Just open up CMakeLists.txt in the main folder and take a look at some of the flags like 

    DO_MYSQL --mysql database support (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, enabled by default)
    DO_POSTGRESQL --postgresql database support (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0)
    DO_SCRIPTS --enable or disable trinity script (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, enabled by default)
    DO_RA --remote administration (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0)
    DO_DEBUG --enable debugging (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0)
    DO_CLI --enable command line support (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, enabled by default)
    LARGE_CELL --enable large cells (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, disabled by default, enabling can cause CPU spikes)
    SHORT_SLEEP --changes sleep time from 100ms to 50ms
    PREFIX --prefix directory for install (see example for use)
    CONF_DIR --location for your trinity config files
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS --advanced users only
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS --advanced users only


Of course, replace the paths in prefix, conf_dir with the directories you wish to install 
Trinity Core to. The datadir is where maps, DBCs, and SQLs are stored. The sysconfdir
is where configuration files are stored.

Once Trinity Core is installed you will need to
apply database updates where necessary. Furthermore, you must
configure your installation by editing the config files in the
sysconfdir.
