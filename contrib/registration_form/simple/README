= Trinity Core -- Account registration form =

Copyright (C) Trinity Core (http://www.trinitycore.org)

This is a very simple account registration form that allows users
to register game accounts on the web.

To run this, you will need:

	* PHP 5.1+
	* MySQL 5.0.45+
	* Any web server

To install this registration form, simply copy the "index.php" to
a folder on your web server. You can rename it to anything you
like, but it's recommended to keep it as "index.php" and put it
in a dedicated directory, such as "/home/public_html/register".

In order for the script to work correctly, you must configure it
in the file itself.
